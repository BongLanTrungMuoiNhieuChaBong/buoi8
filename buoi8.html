                Always up for a challenge, I have worked for lean start-ups and
                was a member of the first New Zealand start-up to attend Y
                Combinator, the largest start-up accelerator in the world. From
                there, I worked my way up to Art Director and Team Lead at
                Appster where I oversaw the design of 30+ mobile and desktop
                apps. Currently I am a Senior Product Designer at Linktree
                leading design for the Linktree mobile app

              "Sebastian is a guru at all things UX design, consistently
              producing intuitive, modern, and bold designs. He is a natural
              problem solver in the design space so everyone went to him if they
              were stuck on a feature or flow. He has a arsenal of design skills
              including animation and graphic design. Not to mention, Seb was a
              design team lead, which means he managed a full team of both
              onshore and offshore designs reviewing and providing feedback on
              all of their designs... Any business would be lucky to have him."
